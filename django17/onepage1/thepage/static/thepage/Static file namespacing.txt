Static file namespacing
------------------------
Now we might be able to get away with putting our static files directly in thepage/static/ (rather than creating another "thepage" subdirectory), but it would actually be a bad idea. 

Django will use the first static file it finds whose name matches, and if you had a static file with the same name in a different application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them. So maybe if we are lucky it will use the correct one, but Murphy's law suggests that that, will not be the case.

We need to be able to point Django at the right one, and the easiest way to ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting those static files inside another directory named for the application itself.
