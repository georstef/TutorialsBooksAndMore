-- LAG(<field>, <Nth>, <default value>) : returns the previous <Nth> value in current window
-- LEAD(<field>, <Nth>, <default value>)  : returns the next <Nth> value in current window
-- FIRST_VALUE(<field>) :  returns the first value in current window based on the default frame (see NOTE)
-- LAG(<field>) : returns the last value in current window based on the default frame (see NOTE) 
--                so it always returns the current value, to get the last value we frame it with: ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
--
-- NOTE: if framing is applicable and we donâ€™t indicate a window frame clause, the default is RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
